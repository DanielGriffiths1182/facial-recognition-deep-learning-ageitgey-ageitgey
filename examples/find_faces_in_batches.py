# This code finds all faces in a list of images using the CNN model.
#
# This demo is for the _special case_ when you need to find faces in LOTS of images very quickly and all the images
# are the exact same size. This is common in video processing applications where you have lots of video frames
# to process.
#
# If you are processing a lot of images and using a GPU with CUDA, batch processing can be ~3x faster then processing
# single images at a time. But if you aren't using a GPU, then batch processing isn't going to be very helpful.
#
# PLEASE NOTE: This example requires OpenCV (the `cv2` library) to be installed only to read the video file.
# OpenCV is *not* required to use the face_recognition library. It's only required if you want to run this
# specific demo. If you have trouble installing it, try any of the other demos that don't require it instead.

    # Save each frame of the video to a list
    frame_count += 1
    frames.append(frame)

    # Every 128 frames (the default batch size), batch process the list of frames to find faces
    if len(frames) == 128:
        batch_of_face_locations = face_recognition.batch_face_locations(frames, number_of_times_to_upsample=0)

        # Now let's list all the faces we found in all 128 frames
